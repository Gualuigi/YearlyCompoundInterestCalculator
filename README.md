# YearlyCompoundInterestCalculator
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- Yearly compound interest calculator for school project, this program calculates the amount accumulated over a year with and without monthly deposits or initial investment.

What did you do particularly well?
- I believe one thing I did well is function calling, Its something i've struggled with in the past, especially when trying to learn Java.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- One of the things I could have changed in the code to make it more efficient is adding a output/input functions to read the user's inputs. Instead of having everything inside the main file, using the functions would have helped make the program a bit cleaner, even if I added the output/input functions into it's own file.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- Suprisingly, one of the things I struggled with most in this project was the math part. I would always have calculations be slightly off, but that was because of the order of the calculations, it would always be off by maybe 2%.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- What I learned most from this project is the actual function calling, working on this project helped me understand how to call functions better, it makes me think of how much I struggled when I first started programming.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- What makes this program adaptable is mostly the functions, you can easily modify the yearly calculator to show monthly calculations(removed when project finished), I used this for debugging the program for precise calculations.
